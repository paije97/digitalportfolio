        <p>Hello! My name is Paije, and I'm so happy to have you here on my digital portfolio.</p>
        <p>I made this digital portfolio as a way to let my potential employers get to know me, and to give them the chance to see what I can do in terms of coding and web development. </p>
        <p>Coding has very quickly become a passion of mine. I love being able to start with nothing and create a beautiful and functional piece of art. I started learning to code because I wanted to develop a new skill, and it's been one of the best decisions I've made for myself in a very long time.</p>
        <p>Now that I've given you a little run down of why you're here, I'd like to get to the "get to know me" portion. I'm 24 years old, and I've been a homemaker and stay at home mother for the majority of my adult life. I enjoy cooking, music, crafts, and spending time with my friends and chosen family. I'm really looking forward to creating a career for myself in web development, because as much as I enjoy keeping a home functioning, I'm also career driven and I'd love to take on the challenge that I know web development will be.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoyed that little peek into my life, and now that you've reached the end, I'd so appreciate it if you'd take the time to check out my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I'd love to have the opportunity to show you more of the projects I've been working on since I started learning to code. Thank you so much for taking the time to get to know me, I look forward to getting to know you as well!</p>
